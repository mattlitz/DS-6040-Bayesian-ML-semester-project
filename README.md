# DS-6040-Bayesian-ML-semester-project
## Authors: Mike Wetklow / Matt Litz

The goal of our project is to apply Bayesian Machine Learning to quantify risk in Federal government grant programs.  Within the Federal government taxpayer dollars are provided to “recipients” to deliver on a range of Federal programs from COVID Recovery, University Research, to Law Enforcement.  Risk in these programs is assessed through audits that identify material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, and non compliance with Federal standards.  Our data set includes Federal government grant audit results collected by the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) for audit years 2019, 2020, and 2021.  Different audit years may show how the pandemic has affected risks in Federal programs.  After data wrangling, we will apply appropriate probabilistic techniques learned in class, based on the characteristics of the problem described above.  Our end goal is to demonstrate the ability to convert actual data science problems from the Federal government domain into formal, mathematical representations.  The value of our project will be to explore how to advance from common “audit-followup” open closed compliance analysis to Bayesian Machine Learning.
